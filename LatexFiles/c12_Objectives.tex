The main target of this document is to describe ou tracking algorithm for surveillance that would be run in an embedded computer inside a UAV \cite{Image_processing_UAV}.  This Final Project is embedded in a huge European Project whose proposal is to develop motion estimation and control method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in order to increase the reliability and safety of these systems. Afterwards, the project aimed to be an environmental descriptor based only on vision sensors as cameras. \\


 
%Firstly, previously to talk about those results, there's an explanation of each fragment of the algorithm and their equations. \\
%The following chapter, is about the first implementation inside a simulator. The program of the ground station would be the same as the real, but quadcopters and cameras are simulated with V-REP software. \\
%Finally, on the last chapter, the application will be tested inside the embedded computers "Odroid u3" in order to get as much information as possible about speediness of the  algorithm and errors on estimations.
