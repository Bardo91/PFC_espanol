The matching consist on link objects between both images. It's an essential step in the algorithm because without step is not possible to track rightly 3D targets.\\

Firstly, in this article it's assumed that camera's behavior is governed by the pinhole model. According to this and assuming that the X axis of the camera define its the orientation, every space point (X,Y,Z) has the following projection. \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pinhole_cam_eq}
\begin{split}
X^{img} = - f*\frac{X}{Z} \\
Y^{img} = f*\frac{Y}{Z}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where f is the focal length of the camera; $X^{img}$ and $Y^{img}$ are the projection of the three dimensional point on the camera plane. This equations are in $\mathbb{R}^3$ the equations of 2 planes that cut in one line (The epipolar line). So in conclusion, every segmented object in the camera's images provide a pair of planes (or a single line). Ideally, if the Segmentation had no errors every pair os lines (One per camera for the same target) will cross in a point. However due to errors is almost improbable. That's why the matching algorithm links the objects by minimizing the distance between lines.

\end{figure}

To be precise, the obtained image in the computer hasn't got negative projection. The values on the image are displaced vertically and horizontally. This displacement is stored as the camera´s image centroid or $(u_0, v_0)$. Eventually, equations are: \\

\begin{align}
X^{img} = u_0 - f*\frac{Y}{X}\\
Y^{img} = v_0 + f*\frac{Z}{X}
\end{align}


Due to the noise in the pictures and in the positioning sensors, the pairs of lines would not ever cut. So that, the application minimize the distance between those lines ( \ref{fig:line-min-dist} ). \\
Let be $P_1$ and $P_2$ two points (The first one belong to the line $r_1$ and the second one to $r_2$). This point are defined respectively as: \\

\begin{align}
P_1 = P_1^0 + u_1 * s \\
P_2 = P_2^0 + u_2 * t
\end{align}


Given the definition of these points, the segment $\overline{P_1P_2}$ will be: \\

\begin{equation}
\overline{P_1P_2}=(P_2^0 - P_1^0) + (u_2 * t - u_1 * s)
\end{equation}


The minimal distance is defined as the length of the perpendicular segment to both lines. Mathematically, $\overline{P_1P_2} * u1 = 0$ and $\overline{P_1P_2} * u2 = 0$. Operating with both equations:

\begin{align}
s = \frac{\frac{u_2 * u_2}{u_2 * u_1}*(P_2 - P_1) * u_1 - (P_2 - P_1) * u_2}{\frac{u_2 * u_2}{u_2 * u_1}(u_1 * u_1) - u_1*u_2}	\\
t = \frac{u_1 *_u1 * s - [P_2 - P_1] * u_1}{u_2 * u_1}
\end{align}

Eventually, $dist(r_1,r_2) = norm(\overline{P_1P_2(s,t)})$.
